# The 2 in 1 Christmans Maze Game
# The next generation Arduino based maze game.

The purpose of the game is to make the ball reach the end from the start avoiding the holes which act like obstacles using the joy stick. My game is for improving coordination, attention, concentration, skills and multitasking.

## Rules, instructions, # of Players.
* You can’t touch the ball and you only have 30 seconds.
* Make the metal ball reach the end from the start using a joys
* Number of players: 2+

# The board has two interesting games. Rules are given below.
## Maze Game
The goal is to take the ball from the start point to the end point avoiding the holes
* You can’t take more than 30 seconds. The children will shout the count down.
* You can’t use anything but the joystick to move the board
* 2 or more players can play this game
T* he person who wins, is the one with most points at the end of 5 rounds
* If two people have same amount of points, they will be both declared the winner
## Hit the bulls eye
* The goal of the game is to click the button when the slow-moving blue light lands on the red light
* If you click the button at the right time, the whole board should turn green signifying you got a point.
* If you click the button at the wrong time, the whole board should turn red signifying you missed.
W* henever you click the button at the right time, the speed of the moving blue light increases by 1/3

## Future Improvements
* The servo motor setup is jerky. Figure out a way to make it smooth.
* The connection between the servo motor and board keeps breaking.
* Hide all the electronics in the board.
* Further improve the looks.
* Have the joystick wirelessly communicate with the game board.
* Solder all the circuitry to a circuit board.
